The MovieLens 100K dataset, which consists of 100,000 ratings from 1,000 users on 1,700 movies, provides an excellent foundation for model development due to its manageable computational demands. This stable benchmark dataset was released in April 1998.Analyzing this dataset enables the extraction of user preferences and movie characteristics, which can subsequently be used to predict the movies
that users are likely to enjoy. Before implementing a recommendation model, however, it is essential to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA helps us understand the structure and properties of the data, identify potential patterns or anomalies, and ensure data quality. This step is crucial because a well-prepared dataset leads to better, more reliable models. In the context of the MovieLens dataset, EDA may help us understand user rating behavior, the distribution of movie genres, and how demographic factors like age and gender influence movie preferences. This analysis will provide insights into the data’s underlying structure, which can then guide the design and simulation of an effective recommendation system, a task the authors plan to undertake as part of another ECAD master’s course.
